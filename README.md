- What was the challenge?

To write queries that gave the results specified in the task

- How I expected the challenge to go.

I was expecting the challenge to be slightly difficult but manageable as I had been following the teaching with no issues.

- What went well?

The task definitely reinforced my mySQL skills as it forced me to put what we had learnt into practice.

- What didn't go as planned?

Although I had followed the teaching without issues, I believe I should have practiced more with the queries as I found that I did not 100% understand the things that I knew. Putting them to practice in this task forced to me understand how certain queries worked.

- Possible improvements for future challenges
Spend some time in the evenings playing around with the queries to get a better understanding of what they do.
